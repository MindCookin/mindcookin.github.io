# Bee Balloon

A game made on ActionScript 3.0 with Box2D framework for collisions and mouse following. Special detail on mouse moves, smooth animations and sound integration, and quickly react to user interactions.

Designed each level carefully, with attention to detail and enjoyable gameplay. One of my personal favorites.
