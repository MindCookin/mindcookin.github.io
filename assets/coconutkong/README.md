About the game
--------------

Have you ever feed a Kong? Now you have the opportunity to do it. Rollover the screen and give our little kong his favourite meal, a coconut!

Coconut Kong is a physics game inspired in old school arcade games. Simple and easy to use, like in the old times. You can play on mobile devices with Accelerometer and with Mouse in desktop devices.

Have a good time, as I had developing it!
